# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Holsen (he/they). I'm a second-year Biology student in the Genetics
& Genomics option at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm currently working
on a research project where I am analyzing the transcriptomes of _Eurycea_
salamanders. I am pursuing a minor in Philosophy of the Mind and Language.

Check out my portfolio repository if you're interested in that.

I've volunteered with sea turtles in the past and have experience mentoring in
a research lab. I am interested in intersectionality and DEI in STEM. My
hobbies are reading, writing, and photography.
