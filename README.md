# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hols (he/they). I'm a second-year Biology/Genetics student. I'm currently working
on a research project where I am analyzing the transcriptomes of _Eurycea_
salamanders.

Check out my portfolio repository if you're interested in that.

I've volunteered with sea turtles in the past and have experience mentoring in
a research lab. I am interested in intersectionality and DEI in STEM. My
hobbies are reading, writing, and photography.
